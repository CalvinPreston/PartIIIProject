# PartIIIProject
Project undertaken by myself under the supervision of Professor George Efstathiou. We placed constraints on the lifetime of decaying dark matter under various scenarios, ultimately concluding such a decay cannpt solve the Hubble tension and only slightly alleviates the S8 tension.

The project consisted of three main stages:

  1: Deriving and numerically solving the equations dictating the conservation and decay of the baryonic, cold dark matter and the radiation components of the universe.      We use LambdaCDM initial conditions from z = 10 to analyse the effect of late-time decays. 
  
  2: Use an MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) anaylsis to constrain the expansion using an inverse distance ladder constructed using baryon acoustic osciallation and SN1a      data that sources a dynamic-free reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe. We can then use this to compare and constrain against our own expansion        history data.
  
  3: Discuss implications of this for formation of structure and evolution in the universe.
  
  4: Qualitatively examine the realisation of decaying dark matter via string theory.
 
The main MCMC analysis used Fortran (courtesy of Fahran Feroz and Mike Hobson). The plotting of confidence maps were done with GetDist.py (courtesy of Antony Lewis). The full .pdf report is available to read. Any questions please contact me: cp662@cam.ac.uk
