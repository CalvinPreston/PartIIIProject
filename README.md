# PartIIIProject
Project undertaken by myself under the supervision of Professor George Efstathiou. We aim to place constraints on the lifetime of decaying dark matter under various scenarios, ultimately concluding such a decay cannpt solve the Hubble tension and 

The project consisted of three main stages:

  1: Deriving and numerically solving the equations dictating the conservation and decay of the baryonic, cold dark matter and the radiation components of the universe.
  
  2: Use an MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) anaylsis to constraint the expansion using baryon acoustic oscillation data and gain a constrained estimate on partcle lifetime.
  
  3: Discuss implications of this for formation of structure and evolution in the universe
